### Info
- Main idea is to separate html and css. (separation of concerns)
- css should be self contained in separate file
- put link style, java scripys in head.
- hexadecimal color is a combination of rgb
- rgb
- rgba (here a is transparancy 0 - 1), decimal value
- use color picker from any online source
- css selectors - element, id, class
- refer id using #, generally for a particilar element or object
- refer class using ".", generally for all the elements like a class.
- "id" can only appear on the page one time. it can be applied to a single html element. doing a multiple will result in error.
